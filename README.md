# Retail-Data-Analytics-with-SQL-and-Pandas
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python (Pandas) and SQL. I worked with a structured dataset (prepared in Python to replicate a retail scenario) and performed:  Data cleaning and preprocessing in Pandas  SQL queries to explore sales performance, customer behavior, and product insights. 

#Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)

SQL (PostgreSQL)

#Methodology
1. Data Cleaning (Python â€“ Pandas)

Handled null values and duplicates

Standardized data types (dates, currencies, categories)

Created new features (e.g., total revenue per order)

2. SQL Analysis

Identified top-selling products

Tracked monthly sales trends

Segmented customers by purchase frequency

Measured revenue contribution by product category

3. Business Insights

The top 20% of customers contributed to ~80% of total revenue

Certain product categories drove consistent sales across months

Seasonal peaks in sales were observed in Q4
